- www.unpkg.com is a website that hosts all npm packages.
- React.js is a JSX framework.
- Babel.js transpiles scripts with type/babel.
- document.querySelector lets you use CSS selector in JS.
- JSX lets you use DOM tags in JS.
- Is this the only special thing about JSX?
- React Components seem to create new "tag" types for JSX.
- Do all class statements in JSX create new tag types?
- React Components have a render() method that must return JSX.
- Do they have any methods other than render()?
- I'm a little confused by the this.props.children call.  Is "innerHTML" usable?
- I'm also a little confused by the type="submit" thing.
- Are the curly brace escapes from DOM elements part of the JSX standard?
