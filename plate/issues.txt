So, let's try to organize this into major areas:
- Add more functionality:
	- Different types of input.
- Generate reports
	Every daily: total, average...or just average?
		- This could be one or more flags on the tasks, that decides what goes into reports.
		- Is there a way we could make the reports into tasks?  $Reports?
			- I like where this is going but it doesn't have any obvious way of working.

- Do we need a "remove from this list" button?  Or, do it in details?
- Bump summary back by one if current day blank (do I already do that?)
