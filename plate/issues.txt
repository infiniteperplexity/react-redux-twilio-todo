- I seem to have chosen passing IDs around rather than data structures.
- I'm not sure where reconciling should happen.  To guarantee intregrity, probably upon data loading?
- So what do I worry about next?  Integrity?  Or adding all kinds of functionality and stuff?
- For the sake of integrity, static lists should probably have no explicit subtasks.  Or wait...well...I do order them.  So instead, just check them at integrity time.
