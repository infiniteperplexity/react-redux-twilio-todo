promethease.html is the report. We're starting hear reports that some (browsers? OSs?) no longer allow double clicking on promethease.html to open the report. That will open the browser, but shows a blank page. If that happens to you, use File->Open to navigate to, then open, promethease.html

The files below 'ui2libs' are support files, that all it to work offline. They aren't needed, nor used, when you have a network connection.
